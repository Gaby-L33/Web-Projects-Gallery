## 📝 Description
Welcome to my frontend practice repository! This project serves as a demonstration of my skills in building clean, responsive, and semantic web interfaces. Understanding the structure of the web is a core pillar of my work as a **QA Tester**, allowing me to perform deeper UI/UX validations.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* **HTML5**: Semantic structure and accessibility.
* **CSS3**: Advanced styling and layout.
* **Flex-box**: Implementation of modern responsive design systems.

## 🔍 QA Perspective
Having a solid foundation in frontend development allows me to:
* Inspect the DOM efficiently to identify UI bugs.
* Understand CSS behaviors for cross-browser testing.
* Collaborate effectively with developers by speaking the same technical language.
